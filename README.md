# Turtlesim Demo Project

This project demonstrates how to run a basic ros2 end to end tests in simulation (here turtlesim).

foobar
## Prerequisite

You will need ROS2 galactic or humble installed.

See instructions [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

## ROS2 tests

You can run the tests with:

```
launch_test launch_turtle.py
```

As it is, the test will fail.

If you take a look at the code, you should be able to find what is wrong and make the test pass.


## Tests with ArtefactsCI


You can use one of the 2 options below.

### With local ROS2 install

Additionally, you can use ArtefactsCI to keep track of your tests results.

1. Create an account and project on ArtefactsCI

2. Install the artefacts client

```
pip install artefacts-client --extra-index-url https://d5cw4z7oemmfd.cloudfront.net/pep503/ -U
```

2. Edit the project name in artefacts.yaml

3. Run the tests with tracking enabled

```
artefacts run basic_tests
```

### Using Docker


Tests on MacOS and Ubuntu 20 often require explictly authorizing access to X11:

    [MacOS] xhost +127.0.0.1: This will start an X11 server if needed, and allow the container to connect.
    [Ubuntu 20] xhost +local:docker

Then build and run the docker container:

```
git clone git@github.com:art-e-fact/warp-client.git
docker build -t turtle2 .
docker run --env ARTEFACTS_KEY=[YOUR-API-KEY] --net host --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v $(pwd):/turtle turtle2
```
